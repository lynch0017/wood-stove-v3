# Template for .env file
# Copy your existing .env content and add the OPENAI_API_KEY line

# InfluxDB Configuration (you already have these)
INFLUXDB_URL=https://your-influxdb-url.com
INFLUXDB_TOKEN=your_influxdb_token_here
INFLUXDB_ORG=your_organization_name
INFLUXDB_BUCKET=your_bucket_name

# OpenAI Configuration (ADD THIS LINE to your .env file)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your_openai_api_key_here

# Important formatting rules:
# - No spaces around the = sign
# - No quotes around values (unless the value itself contains spaces)
# - One variable per line
# - OpenAI API keys typically start with "sk-" or "sk-proj-"
# - Make sure there's no # at the start of the line (that makes it a comment)

# To fix your .env file:
# 1. Open your .env file in a text editor
# 2. Add a new line at the end: OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_key
# 3. Save the file
# 4. Run: python check_env.py (to verify)
# 5. Run: python stove_chat_app.py (to start the server)
