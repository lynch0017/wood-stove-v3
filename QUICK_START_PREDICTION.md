## Example Scenario

**Planning an overnight burn:**

1. **Select**: Drag to select last night's burn (8pm - 4am)
2. **Configure**:
   - Outdoor: 28°F (auto-fetched)
   - Fill: 90% (planning a full load)
   - Wood: 50% Oak / 50% Maple
   - Window: 8 hours
3. **Generate**: Wait 25 seconds
4. **Result**: See predicted temperature curve for tonight

## What You'll See

- **Blue line**: Your actual temperature history
- **Red dashed line**: Predicted future temperature
- **Yellow band**: Uncertainty range (±15%)
- **Green area**: The data used for training (when selecting)

## Pro Tips

✅ **DO:**
- Select similar burn patterns (overnight → overnight)
- Use recent data (yesterday > last week)
- Experiment with different parameters
- Compare predictions to actual results

❌ **DON'T:**
- Rely on this for safety decisions
- Expect perfect accuracy
- Select data with stove off/cold
- Use very short selections (< 5 hours)

## Troubleshooting

**Can't select data?**
→ Make sure "Selection Mode Active" button is green

**Selection too small?**
→ Need at least 5 hours (60 data points)

**Prediction seems wrong?**
→ Try different historical data or check your parameters

**Training takes forever?**
→ Normal! 20-50 seconds is expected

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable:
- Try different wood species combinations
- Compare full vs. partial loads
- Test predictions against reality
- Adjust based on your stove's behavior
